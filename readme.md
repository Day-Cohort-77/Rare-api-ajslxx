# Rare Server


## Getting Started

This repository is just a template with a single, valuable fileâ€”the `.sql` file which shows a sample about how *some* of the tables could be created. This is not a finished, completed file and it is up to the team whether or not you want to use it.

Follow the steps from the course to create a new `dotnet` minimal API project to get started.
